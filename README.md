# Project: Pacman Agents
Intelligent Agents that play Pacman

## PEAS
- **Performance Measures:** Final game score, total survival time

- **Environment:** Board, pellets, power pellets

- **Actuators (Pacman):** At any time: Legal move (Up, Down, Left, Right)

- **Actuators (Ghost):** At junction: Legal move (Up, Down, Left, Right)

- **Sensors:** Board, location of pellets, location of all agents

## Agent Definition
- **PacmanHuman:** Human controlled agent for validation Ghost agent validation.

- **PacmanRandom:** Random agent, used for bulk data collection.

- **GhostRandom:** Random simple reflex agent.

- **GhostGBFS:** Takes the move that moves them closest to Pacman at his current location.

- **GhostMCTS:** Uses Monte Carlo tree search to choose a move when at a junction.

- **GhostSA:** Uses Simulated Annealing to learn what actions will be most likely to capture Pacman.
